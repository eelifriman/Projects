This project assignment was completed for a course in Aalto University: MS-E2112 - Multivariate Statistical Analysis D in the spring of 2024. The assignment instruction was to apply a multivariate statistical analysis method on a some dataset. The implementation was done with R.

During the course, I found Fisher's linear discriminant analysis quite interesting. As a long-time fan of Coldplay, I decided to attempt to group the albums with respect to the song attributes.
