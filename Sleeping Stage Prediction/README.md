This project assignment was completed for a course in Aalto University: CS-C4100 - Digital Health and Human Behavior in the spring of 2024. The assignment instruction was to explore a health related dataset, conduct analysis and write a report on the results. 



As I had multiple courses going at the same time, and the model I chose was quite difficult to implement (logistic regression with a Markov model), I ended up simplifying the model. The original idea was to implement a hidden Markov model. The project really taught me to work under a tight time schedule, and to prioritize on the more important aspects.
