This project assignment was completed for a course in Aalto University: CS-C4100 - Digital Health and Human Behavior in the autumn of 2024. The assignment instruction was to explore a health related dataset, conduct analysis and write a report on the results. 



As I had multiple courses going at the same time, and the model I chose was quite difficult to implement (logistic regression with a Markov model), I ended up simplifying the model (the original idea was to implement a hidden Markov model). 

The project really taught me to work under a tight time schedule, and to prioritize on the more important aspects. Even though the final results were not as great as expected, the project was amazing to work on, and trying to implement and include a Markov model on a Scikit's logistic regression class was a fun task.
