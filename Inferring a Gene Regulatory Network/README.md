This project assignment was completed for the course in Aalto University: CS-E5885 - Modeling Biological Networks D in the spring of 2024. The assignment was to identify a gene regulatory network from gene expression time-course data. The implementation was done with Python.

During the course, I found kernel density estimates (KDE) and the ARACNe algorithm ( An Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Gene Regulatory Networks) quite fascinating. During project work I got to learn a lot about KDE's, and using mutual information to infer network structures.
