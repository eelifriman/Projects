This repository contains project works completed for courses in Aalto University.

NOTE: This repository is only meant for employers/recruiters to view. Therefore, the code files are not necessarily written in a form that allows for further application of the implementations.

NOTE: Most of the project works have been completed with a very limited time frame. Therefore, some of the implementations, especially the harder ones (e.g., CustomLogisticRegression in Predicting Sleeping Stages/.ipynb) have not been implemented optimally. 



Thank you for taking the time to view my work! \
